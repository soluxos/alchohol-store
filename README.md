# alchohol-store
Development around an API endpoint.

This site connects to a JSON endpoint with alchoholic beverages.

This application has some very light styling to try and show that it is a product listing page.

The application does the following with the data:

* Creates a star rating for each product
* Fixes images when they 404
* Includes all standard product data
* Filters out percentage symbol from JSON endpoint

There is a lot more that I'd like to do, but given the time constraint this is all I could achieve. With some more time I would do the following:

* Show a 'Buy before they sell out' message for the low quanitity products.
* Lighten opacity/hide out of stock products.
* Add a pagination to the page.
* Have Ajax filtering logic in place.
* Create a robust column system for styling on the page.
* Create more reusable SCSS for the products.
* Separate some of the JS into a more modular format.
* Filter the JSON in a more sensible way and look for more erroneuous characters.
